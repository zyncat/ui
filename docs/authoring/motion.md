# Motion

- One small WAAPI engine in `src/engine` drives everything. No animation dependency.
- Transitions are destination-driven and run on the engine. Simulations are input-coupled or endless and run on the engine `loop` primitive.

## Transitions versus simulations

- Has a destination: `animate`, `flip`, `set`, or a CSS transition.
- Input-coupled or endless - cursor magnetism, flow fields, particles, sprung counters: `loop`. Never hand-roll a rAF loop.
- `loop(frame, options?)` returns a `Playback`; `finished` resolves on stop.
- `frame(k, dt, now)`: `k` is the 60fps-normalised step, `dt` is milliseconds. Both are speed- and clock-scaled; `dt` is clamped to 34ms.
- `options.speed` is sampled every frame; feed it the live prop. `0` idles the frame, an invalid speed runs at `1`.
- `options.el` plus `options.claims` claim css properties under the one-writer rule. `animate()` on a claimed property stops the loop; stopping releases the claim.
- The loop pauses while the document is hidden or `options.el` is off-screen.
- Under `UIMotion.reduced`, `loop` calls `options.snap` once and never starts.
- Physics constants are named module constants. Perceived settle stays inside the `--duration-*` bands.

## Which layer do I reach for

- Work down the list; stop at the first match. Nothing fits: it is still one of these.
- Paint on hover / press / focus / disabled: a CSS `transition` on `--transition-control` or `--transition-colors`. Never animate paint from JS.
- Enters or leaves the React tree: `<Presence>` around it, `<Motion exit={…}>` on it.
- Move, scale or fade a mounted element you render: `<Motion animate={…}>`. You do not render the node: `animate(el, layer)` or `useMotion(ref, specs)`.
- The box changed because layout changed: `<Motion layout>` or `<Motion layoutId="…">`.
- An indicator following the hovered or active child: `useGlide(containerRef)` + `<GlidePill>`, travelling on `t.glide`.
- Height from zero to content: `<Collapse>`, or `height: [0, 'auto']`.
- Input-coupled or endless: `loop`.
- Never sequence with `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `transitionend` or `animationend`.

## The Layer vocabulary

- A `Layer` is a plain object. These are all the animatable keys:
- `x`, `y` — `Length[]`; compiled into one CSS `translate`.
- `scale` — `number[]`, or per-axis pairs.
- `opacity` — `number[]`.
- `width`, `height` — `Size[]`.
- `radius` — `string[]`; whole `border-radius` shorthands, one per keyframe.
- `timing` — a `Timing`.
- `composite` — `CompositeOperation`; almost always omitted.
- Only `x` or `y` holds the other at `0`. Bare numbers are px; `Size` adds `'auto'`.
- A percentage on `x` / `y` resolves against the element's own box, on `width` / `height` against the containing block.
- `radius` is the corner half of a size morph: animate it with `width` / `height`, never alone.
- `'auto'` measures, animates to the pixel value, then restores `auto` on finish.
- `animate()` takes any number of layers as one `Playback`. Split layers only when parts need different timing.

## `[to]` versus `[from, to]`

- Every value is a keyframe list; the length changes the meaning.
- One frame (`x: [120]`): from the current computed value. Use for exits and interruptions.
- Two or more (`x: [0, 120]`): an explicit path. A two-frame exit teleports to `from` before playing, the most common motion bug here.
- Lists of different lengths are allowed; the shorter holds its last value.

## Timing

- Durations are seconds, not milliseconds.
- `Timing` fields: `duration`, `ease`, `delay`, `times`, `type`, `fill`, `release`. Springs: `type: 'spring'` with `visualDuration` and `bounce`. `fill` defaults to `'both'`, `release` to `false`.
- Prefer `UIMotion.t`: `t.enter`, `t.exit`, `t.layout`, `t.settle`, `t.glide`.
- Read `UIMotion` at call time, never into a module constant. It re-reads when `data-theme` or `data-polarity` changes, `prefers-reduced-motion` flips and after `ZyncatTheme` renders; a hand-injected stylesheet needs `refreshMotionTokens()`.
- `motionFor(el)` is `UIMotion` as it resolves on one element - pass the element being animated, and an overlay its trigger, so a subtree theme retimes WAAPI too. Without an element it is `UIMotion`.
- A component with an `animation` prop never reads `UIMotion` directly: `resolveMotionTiming(animation, defaults, scope)`.

## Ownership: one writer per property

- The engine tracks which animation owns each property, per element. Starting a new animation on a property cancels the holder.
- The engine writes `translate`, `scale`, `opacity`, `width`, `height`, `border-radius`. CSS must not transition a property the engine writes.
- A layer that stacks instead of replacing uses `composite: 'add'`. It does not claim the property; pair it with `fill: 'none'`.
- Hand-written styles lose while an animation holds the property. `set(el, { x: [120] })` writes immediately and drops the claim. `timing: { release: true }` commits, cancels and hands the property back on finish.

## Sequencing

- `animate()` returns a `Playback`: `stop()` and `finished`. `finished` resolves and never rejects, even detached or hidden mid-flight.
- Chain follow-up motion off `finished`. Never a timer, rAF, `transitionend` or `animationend`.
- `clock.scale` scales playback; reduced motion collapses durations. `Presence` already waits on `finished` for exits.

## Reduced motion is global and automatic

- `motion.css` collapses every `--duration-*` to `1ms` under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. `UIMotion` reads the same properties, so CSS and JS shrink together.
- A per-component reduced-motion query may only disable or zero motion: `transition: none`, `animation: none`, a dropped stagger. Never alternative motion. Never branch on `matchMedia` in a component.
- `UIMotion.reduced` is only for when fast is still wrong. Under it: skip FLIP entirely, `t.settle` becomes `{ duration: 0 }`, simulations snap.

## Layout animation

- `<Motion layout>` FLIPs from the previous box whenever a render moves it. That box is read as the render begins, so a box an effect moved after the last commit starts the next FLIP where it truly is. A render that leaves the box in place never restarts a flight in progress.
- `<Motion layoutId="x">` FLIPs from wherever any element last held the id. The node keeping the id does not FLIP its own moves, so an indicator stays on its container; add `layout` for a node that should.
- `<Motion>` creates the FLIP after `animate` in the same commit, so its `composite: 'add'` translate stacks on an entrance: WAAPI composites in creation order.
- `layoutTransition`: `size` is `'scale'` (cheap, distorts borders and radii), `'morph'` (real `width` / `height`, for a visible border or radius) or `'none'`, plus a `timing`.
- `layoutTransition.crossfade: true` loads the crossfade code on the first commit that asks for it, and a handoff before it arrives plays the plain FLIP. The element leaving a `layoutId` stays on screen as an inert copy in a fixed layer on `<body>`. A copy no element claims in that commit fades out in place.
- A crossfade handoff ignores `size` and moves only `translate`, `scale` and `opacity`, so nothing reflows and the compositor runs it. The copy and the incoming element travel centre to centre, scaled uniformly by the ratio of their widths. The copy is gone by 50% of eased progress, and the incoming element reaches its resting opacity by 45%.
- The handoff cancels the incoming element's own `translate`, `scale` and `opacity` animations, so a mount `animate` on them does not play. The copy keeps its classes, inline styles, font, colour and a differing `data-theme` / `data-polarity`; styles it drew from its old ancestors are gone.
- Below components: `flip(el, from, options)` and `measure(el)`.

## Focus and the first frame

- Focus directly in an effect, never deferred. By effect time the element is in the document with layout, and an in-flight entrance does not make it unfocusable.
- A timeout that makes focus "work" means the bug is elsewhere.

## Entrance work lands before the first frame

- An animation created in a layout effect does not start counting there. Its start time stays unresolved until the timeline produces a time at the next rendering opportunity, so main-thread work _before_ the first painted frame costs latency; the same work _after_ it costs dropped frames.
- Everything that decides the first painted frame of an entrance resolves in a layout effect in that same commit: a seeded active index, a scroll position, measured geometry, a glide placement. A passive effect that sets state moves its render to the far side of the first paint by definition, and that render lands inside the running entrance.
- A state update from a layout effect is flushed before paint, so a second pass there is free. A second pass after paint is not.
- This trades jank for latency; it does not remove the work. Shrink the subtree that blocks. Never add delay to buy a clean entrance - a deliberate delay is a timer in disguise.

## Named presets and space tokens

- `src/motion/presets.ts`: `popIn(scale, timing)`, `popOut(scale, timing)`, `slideIn(x, timing)`. Presets take numbers fed from tokens, never literals.
- `UIMotion.scale`: `panel` 0.98, `floating` 0.96, `chip` 0.9. Pick by surface size, not taste.
- `UIMotion.dist`: `sm` 8px, `md` 16px, `lg` 24px. Pick by how far the thing conceptually came.

## Canonical recipes

- Use these. Never invent a variant.

```tsx
// floating surface — popover, menu, tooltip
animate={popIn(UIMotion.scale.floating, timings.open)}
exit={popOut(UIMotion.scale.floating, timings.close)}
// takeover panel — modal; a dialog also rises: y: [UIMotion.dist.sm, 0] on enter, y: [UIMotion.dist.sm] on exit
animate={popIn(UIMotion.scale.panel, timings.open)}
exit={popOut(UIMotion.scale.panel, timings.close)}
// chip inside a group — tag
animate={popIn(UIMotion.scale.chip, step.open)}
exit={popOut(UIMotion.scale.chip, step.close)}
// edge sheet — slides its own size in, then releases the property
animate={{ [axis]: ['100%', 0], timing: { ...timings.open, release: true } }}
exit={{ [axis]: ['100%'], timing: timings.close }}
// paged content swapping in a direction — calendar month, pagination range
animate(el, slideIn(dir * UIMotion.dist.md, UIMotion.t.enter));
```
